# Realize For React

As React applications scale, it becomes more difficult to track state and to have a holistic overview of the component hierarchy. Realize is a tool to help developers visualize the structure and state flow of their React applications, especially when they are growing in scale and complexity. It currently supports React v.16.8.

## üë©‚Äçüíª How to use it 
1. Install the extension from the [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/realize-for-react/llondniabnmnappjekpflmgcikaiilmh) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/realizeforreact/) stores
2. Navigate to your React website
3. Open the dev tools window and select the Realize Panel
4. Trigger a state change to see the component tree populate

  
**Prerequisites**
- Realize requires React Dev Tools to be installed before use.
- Realize is best used on non-deployed applications. This uglification of deployed websites makes the component structure pretty unreadable.
  
## üî• Key Features  
**Zoom & Pan** - Hold down shift to enable dragging and zooming on the tree (to recenter just click the center button)  
**Component Focus** - Click on a node to view state, props and children in the right and panel  
**State Flow** - Click the 'state' toggle to show state flow on the tree. Stateful components have blue nodes and state flow is show by blue links  
**Search and Highlight** - Enter a component name in the search bar to see all matching nodes pulsate
